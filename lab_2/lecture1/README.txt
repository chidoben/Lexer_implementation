Bison examples for the course "Compiler Design", Technische Universitaet Berlin

You can find more information about Bison at http://www.gnu.org/software/bison and http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual
Bison sources are available at http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison

The folder contains two examples you can browse and test with the Bison parser generator:

 1. Hello-world parser (BISON + FLEX)
    is an simpel parser for programs like:
    
    hello-world;
    hello-world ; hello-world ;
    quit;

    To compile the lexer and parser generated by FLEX and BISON test, you should do the following:
> bison -d hello.y -ohello.yy.c  
    which creates hello.yy.c and hello.yy.h. Then we should use FLEX as we have seen in previous lectures:   
> flex -ohello.lex.c hello.lex  
    and finally compile both codes all together:
> gcc -o hello.out hello.yy.c hello.lex.c 

    and then you can execute the parser:
> ./hello.out    
    
    Test it also with strings like ";" and "quit"

    

 2. Simple Calculator (BISON + FLEX)
    is a very simple calculator. 
    It compiles all togheter with:
> bison -d calc.y -ocalc.yy.c
> flex -ocalc.lex.c calc.lex
> gcc -o calc.out calc.yy.c calc.lex.c -lfl
    and runs with 
> ./calc.out        
    
    Note that: 
     a. we added a flag to gcc in order to link a library where yywrap() is already implemented.
     b. the compiler complains about three possible shift/reduce conflicts. Why?
